title: The Google Search API
===

Searching The Google is really easy. Just craft a request like this one:

---
request:
  domain: http://google.com
  uri: /search
  headers:
    content-accept: text/html
===

And choose from a series of very easy parameters like so:

---
request:
  query_string:
    q: 
      description: The URL-encoded search term you wish to Google for.
      example: Now you're thinking with portals
===

The response that comes back is very simple, too:

---
response: 
  status: 200
